# Maze-Man
- Maze man is  a simple java based game developed by myself as a side project to test my Java skills, which centres on  players controlling a user icon and navigating through a maze in order to complete the game
- The goal of the game was to develop an application in java with specific data structures and algorithms being implemented in its creation, such as utilising stacks and lists, and using the Aldous-Broder algorithm for maze generation.
